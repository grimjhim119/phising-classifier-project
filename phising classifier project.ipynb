About the Project\n","Phishing is a type of cyber-attack where attackers send fake emails or messages that look genuine\n","in order to steal sensitive information such as passwords, bank details, or login credentials.\n","\n","This project focuses on building a **Machine Learning based Phishing Classifier** that can\n","automatically detect whether a given text message or email is **Phishing** or **Legitimate**.\n","The system uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze the text and\n","classify it accurately.\n","\n","The model helps in improving online security by identifying suspicious messages at an early stage.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2. Objective of the Project\n","The main objectives of this project are:\n","- To analyze text messages and emails for phishing patterns\n","- To convert text data into numerical form using NLP techniques\n","- To train a Machine Learning model for classification\n","- To predict whether a message is phishing or legitimate\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 3. Technology Used\n","- Python\n","- Google Colab\n","- Pandas and NumPy\n","- Scikit-learn\n","- Machine Learning\n","- Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 4. Dataset Description\n","The dataset used in this project contains text messages along with their labels.\n","\n","- **Text**: Email or message content\n","- **Label**:\n","  - 1 → Phishing\n","  - 0 → Legitimate\n","\n","The dataset includes examples of both phishing and normal messages so that the model can\n","learn the difference between them.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 5. Steps Involved in the Project\n","\n","### Step 1: Import Required Libraries\n","In this step, all the necessary Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn\n","are imported. These libraries are used for data handling, feature extraction, model training,\n","and evaluation.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Step 2: Load or Create Dataset\n","The dataset is loaded into the notebook or created manually for training and testing.\n","The data is stored in a tabular format using a Pandas DataFrame.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Step 3: Data Preprocessing\n","The text data is separated into:\n","- **Input features (X)** – message text\n","- **Output labels (y)** – phishing or legitimate\n","\n","This step prepares the data for model training.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Step 4: Train-Test Split\n","The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.\n","- Training data is used to train the model\n","- Testing data is used to evaluate the model performance\n","\n","This helps in checking how well the model performs on unseen data.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Step 5: Feature Extraction using TF-IDF\n","TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is used to convert text data\n","into numerical vectors.  \n","This allows the Machine Learning model to understand and process text data.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Step 6: Model Training\n","A **Logistic Regression** algorithm is used to train the phishing classifier.\n","It is a simple and effective algorithm for binary classification problems.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Step 7: Model Evaluation\n","The trained model is evaluated using:\n","- Accuracy score\n","- Classification report\n","\n","This step measures how correctly the model predicts phishing and legitimate messages.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Step 8: Prediction on New Input\n","The trained model is tested on new, unseen messages.\n","The system predicts whether the input message is **Phishing** or **Legitimate**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 6. Result\n","The model successfully classifies messages as phishing or legitimate with good accuracy.\n","It demonstrates how Machine Learning and NLP can be used to improve cybersecurity.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 7. Conclusion\n","This project shows that Machine Learning can effectively detect phishing messages.\n","By using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression, the system learns patterns commonly found in\n","phishing texts.\n","\n","The model can be further improved by using:\n","- Larger datasets\n","- Advanced algorithms like Random Forest or XGBoost\n","- Real-time deployment using web applications\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 8. Future Scope\n","- Integration with email filtering systems\n","- Real-time phishing detection\n","- Deployment using Flask or Streamlit\n","- Support for URL-based phishing detection\n"],"metadata":{"id":"9Nff-EtBaoUE"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n","\n","data = {\n","    \"text\": [\n","        \"Verify your bank account now\",\n","        \"Meeting at 10 AM tomorrow\",\n","        \"Update your password immediately\",\n","        \"Lunch with friends\",\n","        \"Account suspended click link\"\n","    ],\n","    \"label\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n","}\n","\n","df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n","\n","X = df['text']\n","y = df['label']\n","\n","X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)\n","\n","vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\n","X_train_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)\n","X_test_vec = vectorizer.transform(X_test)\n","\n","model = LogisticRegression()\n","model.fit(X_train_vec, y_train)\n","\n","y_pred = model.predict(X_test_vec)\n","print(\"Accuracy:\", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"rPHcFBhEaaIF","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1768359059206,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3358,"user":{"displayName":"Rimjhim Gupta","userId":"17442860503033909961"}},"outputId":"334af027-57d6-4e68-a3b9-209ec9f78345"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Accuracy: 0.0\n"]}]}]}
